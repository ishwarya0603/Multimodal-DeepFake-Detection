# DeepFake Detection
## INTRODUCTION

Deepfakes have improved significantly because of breakthroughs in deep learning, making it feasible to produce very realistic but manipulated video or image contents. Such fake contents of media seriously threaten several domains, including misinformation, identity deception, digital security, and social trust. Conventional deep fake detection solutions based on single-modal or static visual characteristics would fail to generalize against highly sophisticated methods of attacks.

With respect to this issue, to enhance the effectiveness of detecting subtle manipulation patterns, this proposed work aims to adopt a unified framework for deepfake detection based on spatiotemporal and contrastive learning supervision.

     In this approach, for effective deepfake image and video manipulation pattern detection, the proposed unified framework combines spatial learning to effectively focus on texture and spatial artifacts of human faces, along with temporal learning to focus on motion inconsistencies between images of video frames.

Further, the use of contrastive supervision is made to improve the ability of the discriminative model by maximizing the separation of the feature space of the real and generated samples. The learning technique allows the model to pay attention to significant differences instead of focusing on trivial patterns, hence improving generalization capability. The proposed method is expected to offer a more accurate, reliable, and efficient way of detecting deepfakes.
